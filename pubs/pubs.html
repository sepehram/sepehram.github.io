	Timing side-channel attacks exploit variations in execution time to infer confidential information 
	from a system's behavior. In this paper, we develop a formal framework for analyzing timing side-channel 
	leakage in cyber-physical systems by modeling their digital twins. We rely on a process-algebraic calculus 
	for digital twins to express timing-sensitive behaviors and define its semantics using probabilistic Markov 
	models. This enables rigorous quantification of information leakage based on execution timing variations. 
	By leveraging entropy-based analysis, we measure an attacker's ability to infer secret states from observable

		Quantitative information flow analysis provides a systematic approach to evaluating the security of a 
		system by measuring the amount of secret information exposed through public outputs. In this paper, we develop 
		a formal framework for quantifying information leakage in cyber-physical systems by modeling their digital twins. 
		We define a process-algebraic calculus for digital twins and specify their semantics using Markovian models, 
		enabling rigorous information flow analysis. Cyber-physical systems operate in an uncountably infinite state 
		space due to their continuous physical behaviors. In contrast, digital twins---through digitization---evolve 
		in a finite space, enabling the feasibility of quantitative information flow analysis using Markovian models. 
		This formulation captures the inherent nondeterminism and probabilistic transitions in cyber-physical systems 
		arising from evolution uncertainties, sensor measurement errors, and concurrent control logic. Leveraging 
		back-bisimulation, we systematically compare an attacker's knowledge of system secrets before and after 
		execution to quantify leakage, relying on Renyi's min-entropy. This approach provides a structured methodology 
		for assessing confidentiality risks in cyber-physical systems and demonstrates the role of digital twins in 
		advancing security analysis.

<blockquote>
Quantitative information flow is a rigorous approach for evaluating the security of a system. 
		It is used to quantify the amount of secret information leaked to the public outputs. In this 
		paper, we propose an automated approach for quantitative information flow analysis of concurrent 
		programs that are running under the control of a probabilistic scheduler. Markovian processes 
		are used to model the behavior of these programs. To this end, we assume that the attacker is 
		capable of observing the internal behavior of the program and propose an equivalence relation, 
		back-bisimulation, to capture the attacker's view of the program behavior. Two partition refinement 
		algorithms are developed to construct the back-bisimulation quotient of the program model and then 
		a quantification method is proposed for computing the information leakage using the quotient. We 
		have implemented our proposed approach as a leakage quantification tool, called PRISM-Leak. It is 
		built on the probabilistic model checker PRISM. Finally, two protocols, dining cryptographers and 
		single preference voting, are analyzed as case studies to show applicability and scalability of the 
		proposed approach compared to other available tools.

<blockquote>
Instrumenting legacy code is an effective approach to enforce security policies. 
		Formal correctness of this approach in the realm of audit logging relies on semantic 
		frameworks that leverage information algebra to model and compare the information 
		content of the generated audit logs and the program at runtime.  Previous work has 
		demonstrated the applicability of instrumentation techniques in the enforcement of 
		audit logging policies for systems with microservices architecture. However, the 
		specified policies suffer from the limited expressivity power as they are confined to 
		Horn clauses being directly used in logic programming engines. In this paper, we explore 
		audit logging specifications that go beyond Horn clauses in certain aspects, and the ways 
		in which these specifications are automatically enforced in microservices. In particular, 
		we explore an instrumentation tool that rewrites Java-based microservices according to a 
		JSON specification of audit logging requirements, where these logging requirements are not 
		limited to Horn clauses. The rewritten set of microservices are then automatically enabled 
		to generate audit logs that are shown to be formally correct.

 Quantifying information leakage of probabilistic programs using the

<blockquote>
Information leakage is the flow of information from secret inputs of a program to its public 
		outputs. One effective approach to identify information leakage and potentially preserve 
		the confidentiality of a program is to quantify the flow of information that is associated 
		with the execution of that program, and check whether this value meets predefined thresholds. 
		For example, the program may be considered insecure, if this quantified value is higher than 
		the threshold. In this paper, an automated method is proposed to compute the information leakage 
		of probabilistic programs. We use Markov chains to model these programs, and reduce the problem 
		of measuring the information leakage to the problem of computing the joint probabilities of 
		secrets and public outputs. The proposed method traverses the Markov chain to find the secret 
		inputs and the public outputs and subsequently, calculate the joint probabilities. The method has 
		been implemented into a tool called PRISM-Leak, which uses the PRISM model checker to build the 
		Markov chain of input programs. The applicability of the proposed method is highlighted by 
		analyzing a probabilistic protocol and quantifying its leakage.

 Correct audit logging in concurrent systems with negative triggers.

<a href="https://sepehram.github.io/pubs/tr21.pdf">.pdf</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote>
In previous work, we had proposed the semantics of correct audit logging in concurrent 
		systems using information algebra, and then had proposed an implementation model in 
		&pi;-calculus that instruments programs to generate correct audit logs according to 
		the proposed semantic framework. The proposed instrumentation algorithm receives audit 
		logging requirements specified in Horn clause logic that specify a collection of events 
		(positive triggers) as preconditions to log.  In this work, we extend the formal 
		specification of audit logging requirements with negative triggers (along with positive 
		ones) to boost the expressivity of the audit logging policies, i.e., a collection of 
		events that should not happen as precondition to log. This way, our language of audit 
		logging requirement specifications goes beyond Horn clauses. We show that the original 
		instrumentation algorithm is potent enough to emit programs that 
		generate correct audit logs at runtime.

<blockquote>
Hybrid-dynamic models provide an underlying framework to study the 
  		evergrowing cyber-physical systems with an emphasis on the integration 
		of their discrete computational steps and the associated continuous physical 
		dynamics. Ubiquity of cyber-physical systems necessitates some level of 
		assurance about the secure flow of information through different discrete and 
		continuous components. In recent years, different logical frameworks have 
		been proposed to analyze indirect information flows in cyber-physical systems. 
		While these frameworks are used to verify secure flow of information in a 
		metalevel, they naturally fall short in support of implementing information flow 
		analyzers that could effectively enforce policies at runtime. This practical 
		limitation has triggered the implementation of direct information flow analyzers 
		in different language settings. In this paper, we focus on direct flows of 
		information confidentiality in hybrid-dynamic environments and propose a 
		semantic framework through which we can judge about such flows. This 
		semantic framework can be used to study the correctness of enforced policies 
		by these analyzers, and in particular taint tracking tools. In this regard, we 
		specify a dynamic taint tracking policy for hybrid dynamic systems and prove 
		its soundness based on the proposed semantic framework. As a case study, 
		we consider the flow of information in a public transportation control system, 
		and the effectiveness of our enforced policy on this system.

<blockquote>
Audit logging provides post-facto analysis of runtime behavior for 
		different purposes, including error detection, amelioration of system 
		operations, and the establishment of security in depth. This necessitates 
		some level of assurance on the quality of the generated audit logs, i.e., 
		how well the audit log represents the events transpired during the execution. 
		Information-algebraic techniques have been proposed to formally specify this 
		relation and provide a framework to study correct audit log generation in a 
		provable fashion. However, previous work fall short on how to guarantee this 
		property of audit logging in concurrent environments. In this paper, we study 
		an implementation model in a concurrent environment. We propose an algorithm 
		that instruments a concurrent system according to a formal  specification of 
		audit logging requirements, so that any instrumented concurrent system 
		guarantees correct audit log generation. As an application, we consider systems 
		with microservices architecture, where logging an event by a microservice is 
		conditioned on the occurrence of a collection of events that take place in 
		other microservices of the system.

Dynamic taint analysis is often used as a defense against 
		low-integrity data in applications with untrusted user interfaces. 
		An important example is defense against XSS and injection attacks 
		in programs with web interfaces. Data sanitization is commonly used 
		in this context, and can be treated as a precondition for endorsement 
		in a dynamic integrity taint analysis. However, sanitization is often 
		incomplete in practice. We develop a model of dynamic integrity taint 
		analysis for Java that addresses imperfect sanitization with an in-depth 
		approach. To avoid false positives, results of sanitization are endorsed 
		for access control (aka prospective security), but are tracked and logged 
		for auditing and accountability (aka retrospective security). We show how 
		this heterogeneous prospective/retrospective mechanism can be specified 
		as a uniform policy, separate from code. We then use this policy to 
		establish correctness conditions for a program rewriting algorithm that 
		instruments code for the analysis. These conditions synergize our previous 
		work on the semantics of audit logging with explicit integrity which is an 
		analogue of noninterference for taint analysis. A technical contribution of 
		our work is the extension of explicit integrity to a high-level functional 
		language setting with structured data, vs. previous systems that only address 
		low level languages with unstructured data. Our approach considers endorsement 
		which is crucial to address sanitization. An implementation of our rewriting 
		algorithm is presented that hardens the OpenMRS medical records software system 
		with in-depth taint analysis, along with an empirical evaluation of the overhead 
		imposed by instrumentation. Our results show that this instrumentation is

<blockquote>
In large scale storage systems such as data centers,  the layout of data 
		on storage disks needs to be frequently reconfigured  for load 
		balancing purposes or in the event of system failure/upgrades. 
		This reconfiguration event, referred to as <i>data migration</i>, 
		must be completed efficiently as the system tends to perform sub-optimally 
		during such process. The data-migration problem has been studied extensively 
		in the literature with efficient algorithms presented for  homogeneous 
		(all storage disks have similar capabilities)  and heterogeneous 
		(storage disks can have different capabilities) cases. <p>
		In this paper, we investigate adding <i>data forwarding</i> to existing 
		algorithms for the heterogeneous data migration problem. In data forwarding, 
		we introduce additional storage nodes (called bypass nodes) during the 
		migration process. Our simulations show that  adding as few as 2 bypass 
		nodes with limited capabilities can improve the performance by up to 15% 
		and adding more bypass nodes with heterogeneous capabilities can improve 
		the migration performance by 25%. We then present a novel algorithm that 
		makes intrinsic use of bypass nodes and show that the algorithm can always 
		achieve an optimal migration schedule while adding no more than 
		 &alpha;&#215;<em>n</em>/3 bypass nodes where <em>n</em> is the numbers of disks and 
		&alpha; is a term defined to reflect the heterogeneity factor of disks.

 <em>A Formal Approach to Combining Prospective and Retrospective
  Security</em>.
 PhD thesis, The University of Vermont, July 2017.
[&nbsp;<a href="pubs_bib.html#amirmoh-phd-thesis">bib</a>&nbsp;| 
<a href="https://sepehram.github.io/pubs/thesis.pdf">.pdf</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote>
The major goal of this dissertation is to enhance software security by 
		provably correct enforcement of in-depth policies. In-depth security 
		policies allude to heterogeneous specification of security strategies 
		that are required to be followed <i>before</i> and <i>after</i> 
		sensitive operations. Prospective security is the enforcement of 
		security, or detection of security violations before the execution of 
		sensitive operations, e.g., in authorization, authentication and 
		information flow. Retrospective security refers to security checks 
		after the execution of sensitive operations, which is accomplished 
		through accountability and deterrence. Retrospective security frameworks 
		are built upon <em>auditing</em> in order to provide sufficient evidence 
		to hold users accountable for their actions and potentially support 
		other remediation actions. Correctness and efficiency of audit logs play 
		significant roles in reaching the accountability goals that are required 
		by retrospective, and consequently, in-depth security policies. This 
		dissertation addresses correct audit logging in a formal framework.<p>
		Leveraging retrospective controls beside the existing prospective 
		measures enhances security in numerous applications. This dissertation 
		focuses on two major application spaces for in-depth enforcement. The 
		first is to enhance prospective security through surveillance and 
		accountability. For example, authorization mechanisms could be improved 
		by guaranteed retrospective checks in environments where there is a 
		high cost of access denial, e.g., healthcare systems. The second 
		application space is the amelioration of potentially flawed prospective 
		measures through retrospective checks. For instance, erroneous 
		implementations of input sanitization methods expose vulnerabilities in 
		taint analysis tools that enforce direct flow of data integrity policies. 
		In this regard, we propose an in-depth enforcement framework to mitigate 
		such problems. We also propose a general semantic notion of explicit flow 
		of information integrity in a high-level language with sanitization. <p>
		This dissertation studies the ways by which prospective and retrospective 
		security could be enforced uniformly in a provably correct manner to handle 
		security challenges in legacy systems. Provable correctness of our results 
		relies on the formal Programming Languages-based approach that we have 
		taken in order to provide software security assurance. Moreover, this 
		dissertation includes the implementation of such in-depth enforcement 
		mechanisms for a medical records web application.

    		analysis for Java that addresses imperfect sanitization with an in-depth 
    		approach.  To avoid false positives, results of sanitization are endorsed 
    		for access control (aka prospective security), but are tracked and logged 
    		for auditing and accountability (aka retrospective security). We show how 
    		this heterogeneous prospective/retrospective mechanism can be specified 
    		as a uniform policy, separate from code.  We then use this policy to 
    		establish correctness conditions for a program rewriting algorithm that 
    		instruments code for the analysis.  The rewriting itself is a model of 
    		existing, efficient Java taint analysis tools.

 Correct audit logging: Theory and practice.

<blockquote>
Retrospective security has become increasingly important to the
    		 theory and practice of cyber security, with auditing a crucial component
    		 of it. However, in systems where auditing is used, programs are 
    		 typically instrumented to generate audit logs using manual, ad-hoc 
    		 strategies. This is a potential source of error even if log analysis 
    		 techniques are formal, since the relation of the log itself to program 
    		 execution is unclear. This paper focuses on provably correct program 
    		 rewriting algorithms for instrumenting formal logging specifications. 
    		 Correctness guarantees that the execution of an instrumented program 
    		 produces sound and complete audit logs, properties defined by an 
    		 information containment relation between logs and the program's logging 
    		 semantics. We also propose a program rewriting approach to 
    		 instrumentation for audit log generation, in a manner that guarantees 
    		 correct log generation even for untrusted programs. As a case study, we 
    		 develop such a tool for OpenMRS, a popular medical records management 
    		 system, and consider instrumentation of break the glass policies.

Retrospective security is an important element of layered 
    security systems. Auditing is central to the theory and practice of 
    retrospective security, however, in systems where auditing is used, 
    programs are typically instrumented to generate audit logs using manual, 
    ad-hoc strategies. This is a potential source of error even if log auditing
    techniques are formal, since the relation of the log itself to program 
    execution is unclear.  This paper focuses on provably correct program 
    rewriting algorithms for instrumenting formal logging specifications. 
    Correctness guarantees that execution of an instrumented program produces 
    sound and complete audit logs,  properties defined by an information 
    containment relation between logs and the program's logging semantics. As 
    an application example, we consider auditing for break the glass policies, 
    wherein authorization is replaced by auditing in emergency conditions.

 The theory and practice of correct audit logging.

 Noninterference in a predicative polymorphic calculus for access
  control.
 <em>Computer Languages, Systems &amp; Structures</em>, 39(3):109--120,

<blockquote>
Polymorphic programming languages have been adapted for 
    		constructing distributed access control systems, where a program represents
	    a proof of eligibility according to a given policy.  As a security 
    		requirement, it is typically stated that the programs of such languages 
	    should satisfy noninterference. However, this property has not been defined 
    		and proven semantically.  In this paper, we first propose a semantics based 
	    on Henkin models for a predicative polymorphic access control language 
    		based on lambda-calculus. A formal semantic definition of noninterference 
	    is then proposed through logical relations.  We prove a type soundness 
    		theorem which states that any well-typed program of our language meets the
	    noninterference property defined in this paper.  In this way, it is 
    		guaranteed that access requests from an entity do not interfere with those 
	    from unrelated or more trusted entities.
