  title = {A Formal Approach to Combining Prospective and Retrospective Security},
  school = {The University of Vermont},
  year = {2017},
  month = {July},
  pdf = {https://sepehram.github.io/pubs/thesis.pdf},
  abstract = {The major goal of this dissertation is to enhance software security by 
		provably correct enforcement of in-depth policies. In-depth security 
		policies allude to heterogeneous specification of security strategies 
		that are required to be followed \textit{before} and \textit{after} 
		sensitive operations. Prospective security is the enforcement of 
		security, or detection of security violations before the execution of 
		sensitive operations, e.g., in authorization, authentication and 
		information flow. Retrospective security refers to security checks 
		after the execution of sensitive operations, which is accomplished 
		through accountability and deterrence. Retrospective security frameworks 
		are built upon \emph{auditing} in order to provide sufficient evidence 
		to hold users accountable for their actions and potentially support 
		other remediation actions. Correctness and efficiency of audit logs play 
		significant roles in reaching the accountability goals that are required 
		by retrospective, and consequently, in-depth security policies. This 
		dissertation addresses correct audit logging in a formal framework.

		Leveraging retrospective controls beside the existing prospective 
		measures enhances security in numerous applications. This dissertation 
		focuses on two major application spaces for in-depth enforcement. The 
		first is to enhance prospective security through surveillance and 
		accountability. For example, authorization mechanisms could be improved 
		by guaranteed retrospective checks in environments where there is a 
		high cost of access denial, e.g., healthcare systems. The second 
		application space is the amelioration of potentially flawed prospective 
		measures through retrospective checks. For instance, erroneous 
		implementations of input sanitization methods expose vulnerabilities in 
		taint analysis tools that enforce direct flow of data integrity policies. 
		In this regard, we propose an in-depth enforcement framework to mitigate 
		such problems. We also propose a general semantic notion of explicit flow 
		of information integrity in a high-level language with sanitization. 

		This dissertation studies the ways by which prospective and retrospective 
		security could be enforced uniformly in a provably correct manner to handle 
		security challenges in legacy systems. Provable correctness of our results 
		relies on the formal Programming Languages-based approach that we have 
		taken in order to provide software security assurance. Moreover, this 
		dissertation includes the implementation of such in-depth enforcement 
		mechanisms for a medical records web application.}

  abstract = {In large scale storage systems such as data centers,  the layout of data 
		on storage disks needs to be frequently reconfigured  for load 
		balancing purposes or in the event of system failure/upgrades. 
		This reconfiguration event, referred to as \textit{data migration}, 
		must be completed efficiently as the system tends to perform sub-optimally 
		during such process. The data-migration problem has been studied extensively 
		in the literature with efficient algorithms presented for  homogeneous 
		(all storage disks have similar capabilities)  and heterogeneous 
		(storage disks can have different capabilities) cases. 

		In this paper, we investigate adding \textit{data forwarding} to existing 
		algorithms for the heterogeneous data migration problem. In data forwarding, 
		we introduce additional storage nodes (called bypass nodes) during the 
		migration process. Our simulations show that  adding as few as 2 bypass 
		nodes with limited capabilities can improve the performance by up to 15\% 
		and adding more bypass nodes with heterogeneous capabilities can improve 
		the migration performance by 25\%. We then present a novel algorithm that 
		makes intrinsic use of bypass nodes and show that the algorithm can always 
		achieve an optimal migration schedule while adding no more than 
		$ \alpha \times n/3$ bypass nodes where $n$ is the numbers of disks and 
		$\alpha$ is a term defined to reflect the heterogeneity factor of disks.}

		It is used to quantify the amount of secret information leaked to the public outputs. In this 
		paper, we propose an automated approach for quantitative information flow analysis of concurrent 
		programs that are running under the control of a probabilistic scheduler. Markovian processes 
		are used to model the behavior of these programs. To this end, we assume that the attacker is 
		capable of observing the internal behavior of the program and propose an equivalence relation, 
		back-bisimulation, to capture the attacker's view of the program behavior. Two partition refinement 
		algorithms are developed to construct the back-bisimulation quotient of the program model and then 
		a quantification method is proposed for computing the information leakage using the quotient. We 
		have implemented our proposed approach as a leakage quantification tool, called PRISM-Leak. It is 
		built on the probabilistic model checker PRISM. Finally, two protocols, dining cryptographers and 
		single preference voting, are analyzed as case studies to show applicability and scalability of the 
		proposed approach compared to other available tools.}

		audit logging across various discrete and continuous components of these systems. This paper explores 
		an implementation model for cyber-physical systems. We introduce an algorithm designed to equip such 
		systems in accordance with a formal specification of audit logging requirements, which provably ensures 
		the generation of accurate audit logs in any instrumented system. The accuracy of the audit log is studied 
		within an information-algebraic semantic framework of audit logging.}

		and enhancing test coverage. Traditional approaches face challenges in scaling and ensuring thorough compliance. 
		LLMs, with their natural language understanding capabilities, offer a promising solution by automating the 
		extraction of specifications from Request for Comments (RFCs) and generating structured models and test cases. 
		Relevant studies, tools and frameworks are reviewed and analyzed to understand how LLMs are used in this area. 
		The paper discusses their strengths and limitations, aiming to support further research on LLMs to improve the 
		reliability and efficiency of network protocol testing.}

		system by measuring the amount of secret information exposed through public outputs. In this paper, we develop 
		a formal framework for quantifying information leakage in cyber-physical systems by modeling their digital twins. 
		We define a process-algebraic calculus for digital twins and specify their semantics using Markovian models, 
		enabling rigorous information flow analysis. Cyber-physical systems operate in an uncountably infinite state 
		space due to their continuous physical behaviors. In contrast, digital twins---through digitization---evolve 
		in a finite space, enabling the feasibility of quantitative information flow analysis using Markovian models. 
		This formulation captures the inherent nondeterminism and probabilistic transitions in cyber-physical systems 
		arising from evolution uncertainties, sensor measurement errors, and concurrent control logic. Leveraging 
		back-bisimulation, we systematically compare an attacker's knowledge of system secrets before and after 
		execution to quantify leakage, relying on Renyi's min-entropy. This approach provides a structured methodology 
		for assessing confidentiality risks in cyber-physical systems and demonstrates the role of digital twins in 
		advancing security analysis. }
