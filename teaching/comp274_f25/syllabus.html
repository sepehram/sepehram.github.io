<p class="firstpara" align="justify">
With the technological advancements, critical systems (e.g., in the aerospace industry, healthcare industry, etc.) are being deployed and used in a 
widespread fashion. This trend, along with the increasing complexity of such systems, necessitate their software components to provide guaranteed 
reliability and assurance. This course introduces a mathematical foundation for rigorous analysis of computer programs, by exploring the logical 
underpinnings and the tools that are used to reason about program correctness in order to develop high quality and robust software. This is 
accomplished by leveraging mechanized verification tools in a hands-on manner, in particular using Coq proof assistant. Mechanized verification 
of programs ensures that the software is "correct", i.e., it behaves properly, using machine-checkable mathematical theorem proving. In this course, 
the students engage in writing programs that formally define system constructs, specify the properties of interest, and prove the satisfaction of those 
properties in the system.

<b><i>Prerequisites:</i></b> COMP 141 and COMP 147 with a “C" or better and graduate or blended students in the School of Engineering and Computer 
Science or instructor approval. 
<br>
<i>When enrolling in this course, you should already understand the basics of functional programming, e.g., data types, pattern matching, 
   recursive definitions, etc. Understanding how programming language syntax and semantics work is also required. Further, you should be comfortable 
   with basic mathematical concepts such as theorems, proofs, induction, contradiction, etc.</i>

<b><i>Attendance:</i></b> 
Class attendance and participation is necessary and expected. There will be numerous activities in class, and these activities cannot be made up outside of class.  
Participation requires that you are properly prepared for classroom quizzes, discussions and labs, and have completed all reading assignments 
before the relevant class. <!--<b><i>Note that more than three unexcused absences will result in a 10% reduction of the final grade.</i></b> -->

You will only be allowed <i><u>three excused or unexcused class misses</u></i> during the semester. The only acceptable excuses for missing a class, 
an assignment due date, or an exam are serious illness, family emergency or important professional, academic or athletic activities. Illness or 
family emergency may require documentation. Excuses for professional, academic or athletic activities must be 
approved by the instructor in advance.  <u><i>After three misses, no excuses will be accepted.</i></u>

Students missing a class are responsible for making up the material discussed in that class on their own. 
Students are responsible for being aware of any announcements made during their absence.

<p class="firstpara" align="justify">
The Honor Code at the University of the Pacific calls upon each student to exhibit a high degree of maturity, responsibility, and personal integrity. Students are expected to:</p>
<div class="box" align="justify">
<ul><ul>
<li>Act honestly in all matters</li>
<li>Actively encourage academic integrity</li>
<li>Discourage any form of cheating or dishonesty by others</li>

</ul></ul>
</div>
<p class="firstpara" align="justify">
Violations will be referred to and investigated by the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards. If a student is found responsible, it will be documented as part of her or his permanent academic record. A student may receive a range of penalties, including failure of an assignment, failure of the course, suspension, or dismissal from the University. The Academic Honesty Policy is located in Tiger Lore and <a href="http://www.pacific.edu/Campus-Life/Safety-and-Conduct/Student-Conduct/Tiger-Lore-Student-Handbook-.html">online</a>.

<p class="firstpara" align="justify">
<b><i>Course-specific Honor Code Policy: </i></b>Engineering is generally a cooperative endeavor and collaborative learning can be a valuable experience for all involved. However, proper assessment (i.e., grading) requires that work be done by individuals. To balance these two requirements, the following policy will apply:</p>

<div class="box" align="justify">
<ul><ul>
<li>Collaborative work on course assignments is encouraged. This includes working together on planning solution strategies and helping each other to debug programs.</li>
<li><i><u>Collaboration must stop short of someone else writing your assignment.</u></i> You may not directly copy the work of another student. You also may not copy the work of another student, and then modify it so that it does not look the same as the original author's work. It is your responsibility to ensure that the work you submit is an honest representation of your own understanding of the material.</li>
</ul></ul>
</div>

<p class="firstpara" align="justify">
Marginal cases will be resolved by oral examination of the student(s) involved. If they each understand the material in the assignment, it will be considered honest collaboration. If they do not, then it will be considered academic dishonesty.
<p>

<p class="firstpara" align="justify">
In many cases, it may be possible to identify reusable source code from textbooks, web sites or other resources that can help you with assignments.  You are permitted to use such references provided that:
<p>

<div class="box" align="justify">
<ul><ul>
<li>The amount of code reused does not exceed 25% of the total assignment length, and</li>
<li><i><u>In the source code comments, you clearly identify any code that you did not write,</u></i> state where it came from, and to what extent you modified it. </li>
