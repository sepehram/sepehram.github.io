The vision for this course is: <i>What do I, as a computer scientist, need 
to understand about the fundamental concepts in programming languages and 
what are the different features by which I can realize whether a given 
programming language is appropriate in a given project?</i>
</p>
<p class="firstpara" align="justify">
There are two main themes in this course:
<div class="box" align="justify">
<ul><ul>
<li>The internal structure of programming languages, and how we can deploy (~50%)
them</li>
<li>Different paradigms of programming (beyond object-oriented) (~50%)</li>

<i><b>Release and Submission</b></i>
<div class="box" align="justify">
<ul><ul>
<li><b>Reading/Watching Assignments</b>: These assignments will be released on
the course Canvas page at most one or two days before each lecture 
session. Students must study/watch the referred material before
each class session. <u>There are not any submissions for reading/watching
assignments, however it is highly recommended to follow these assignments 
before each lecture session in order to be prepared for classroom 
activities.</u> Reading/Watching assignments are considered as <b>individual</b> efforts.</li>
<li><b>Quizzes</b>: Each session comes with a brief quizz (5-10 minutes) that reflects on the material 
   covered in the reading/watching assignment associated with that class session. Quizzes are published and automatically 
   graded in Canvas. They are due at the beginning of each class session. Quizzes are considered as <b>individual</b> efforts.</li>
<li><b>Labs</b>: Labs will be released on the course Canvas page at latest at the beginning of each lecture session. 
  Submissions after 11:59PM of the same day <u>will not</u> be accepted.</u> 
  The due date for labs might be postponed, if considered necessary during the semester. 
  Lab assignments are considered to be <b>group-based</b>. Group sizes cannot exceed 2 students, defined at the beginning of the semester.
  The goal is to accomplish all labs and submit in Canvas until the end of that day. 
  </li>
<li>
  <b>Class Activities</b>: These activities involve participation during in-class collaborative exercises. 
  The aim is to actively engage in discussions, problem-solving, or any assigned tasks alongside peers during each session. 
  The grade for this category will be subjective, based on the level of engagement and contribution demonstrated by each student during the class. 
  Class activities serve as a more meaningful measure of attendance. Class activities are considered to be <b>group-based</b>. These groups will
  be created in ad-hoc manner each session, and their size may vary from session to session.
</li>

<li><b>Course Projects</b>: These assignments will be released on the course Canvas page
with a clearly indicated due date. Timely submissions are accepted until 
11:59PM on the due date. Projects are <b>group-based</b>. Group sizes cannot exceed 2 students, defined at the beginning of the semester.
</li>

<li>
  <b>Programming Languages Day Assignment</b>: 
  This assignment involves teaching a new programming language during a full class session. Each group (3-4 students, formed during the first week 
  of the semester) will prepare and deliver content covering the language's features, use cases, and a live demonstration, ensuring all members 
  actively contribute to both preparation and delivery. Detailed requirements and grading criteria will be provided in advance. This assignment 
  is considered <b>group-based</b>.

<b><i>Course-specific Honor Code Policy: </i></b>Engineering is generally 
a cooperative endeavor and collaborative learning can be a valuable 
experience for all involved. However, proper assessment (i.e., grading) 
requires that work be done by individuals. To balance these two 
requirements, the following policy will apply:</p>

<li>Collaborative work on course assignments is encouraged. This includes 
working together on planning solution strategies and helping each other to 
debug programs.</li>
<li><i><u>Collaboration must stop short of someone else writing your

You also may not copy the work of another student, and then modify it so 
that it does not look the same as the original author's work. It is your 
responsibility to ensure that the work you submit is an honest 
representation of your own understanding of the material.</li>
</ul></ul>
</div>

<p class="firstpara" align="justify">
Marginal cases will be resolved by oral examination of the student(s) 
involved. If they each understand the material in the assignment, it will

considered academic dishonesty.
