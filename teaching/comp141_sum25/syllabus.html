<h2 align="left">Learning Objectives</h2>
<p class="firstpara" align="justify">
The vision for this course is: <i>What do I, as a computer scientist, need 
to understand about the fundamental concepts in programming languages and 
what are the different features by which I can realize whether a given 
programming language is appropriate in a given project?</i>
</p>
<p class="firstpara" align="justify">
There are two main themes in this course:
<div class="box" align="justify">
<ul><ul>
<li>The internal structure of programming languages, and how we can deploy (~60%)
them</li>
<li>Different paradigms of programming (beyond object-oriented) (~40%)</li>
</ul></ul>
</div>
</p>

<p class="firstpara" align="justify">
You will have many different opportunities to gain this knowledge through:
<div class="box" align="justify">
<ul><ul>
<li>Group-based Labs</li>
<li>Discussions, quizzes, exams, and reading/watching assignments</li>
</ul></ul>
</div>
</p>

<p class="firstpara" align="justify">
After taking this course, you should be able to:
<div class="box" align="justify">
<ul><ul>
<li>Use multiple programming languages to write simple programs.</li>
<li>Identify the features that programming languages have in common and 
the ways that they differ, particularly between the four major programming 
paradigms.</li>
<li>Recognize features from known languages when learning a new 
programming language.</li>
<li>Describe how the features provided by programming languages are 
implemented by compilers and interpreters. Consider efficiency and 
readability in the design choices made while writing code.</li>
<li>Assess appropriateness of a language for a specific project.</li>
<!--<li>Conduct research and report on technical information.</li>-->

the course Canvas page at most one or two days before each lecture

assignments, however it is highly recommended to follow the reading assignments
before watching the lecture videos. This would help you better prepare for quizzes and labs. </u>
Reading/Watching assignments are considered as individual efforts.</li>

    material covered in the reading/watching assignment associated with that class session.
    Quizzes are published and automatically graded in Canvas. There will be no extensions to quiz due dates.
    These assignments are considered as individual efforts.</li>

<li><b>Labs</b>: Labs will be released on the course Canvas page at the beginning of each lecture session.
    The goal is to accomplish all class activities and submit in Canvas until the end of that day.
    Submissions after 11:59PM of the same day <u>will not</u> be accepted.</u> The due date for labs
    might be postponed, if considered necessary during the semester. Lab assignments are considered to be individual.</li>

assignment, failure of the course, suspension, or dismissal from the

<b><i>Course-specific Honor Code Policy: </i></b>Engineering is generally 
a cooperative endeavor and collaborative learning can be a valuable 
experience for all involved. However, proper assessment (i.e., grading) 
requires that work be done by individuals. To balance these two 
requirements, the following policy will apply:</p>

<div class="box" align="justify">
<ul><ul>
<li>Collaborative work on course assignments is encouraged. This includes 
working together on planning solution strategies and helping each other to 
debug programs.</li>
<li><i><u>Collaboration must stop short of someone else writing your 
assignment.</u></i> You may not directly copy the work of another student. 
You also may not copy the work of another student, and then modify it so 
that it does not look the same as the original author's work. It is your 
responsibility to ensure that the work you submit is an honest 
representation of your own understanding of the material.</li>
</ul></ul>
</div>

<p class="firstpara" align="justify">
Marginal cases will be resolved by oral examination of the student(s) 
involved. If they each understand the material in the assignment, it will 
be considered honest collaboration. If they do not, then it will be 
considered academic dishonesty.
